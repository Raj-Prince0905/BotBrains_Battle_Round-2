# Two Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot (TWSBR) Project

## Overview
Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robots (TWSBR) are advanced robotic systems designed to maintain balance while navigating various terrains and performing tasks such as personal transportation or parcel delivery. Utilizing gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sophisticated control algorithms, TWSBRs can dynamically adjust their orientation to stay upright and navigate complex environments.

This project explores key aspects of designing, enhancing, and programming TWSBRs to optimize their performance and utility.
